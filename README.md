# Hi 👋, I'm  Andrii.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I tinker with code just for the fun of it! This isn't my main professional space, but rather a playground for ideas, experiments, and projects that spark my curiosity.

## My Story  🚀

While I find immense satisfaction in the logical world of AI and databases, my life isn't just about lines of code and data structures! When I step away from the keyboard, you'll often find me with my hands in the soil or a cue stick in my hand.

Gardening is my sanctuary. There's something incredibly grounding about nurturing plants and watching them grow. My favorites? I have a soft spot for **the vibrant colors of my sunflowers** and **the calming scent of lavender**. It's a wonderful way to disconnect and reconnect with the natural world.

And then there's the click of the balls on the billiard table. I love the focus and strategy involved in a good game of billiards. It's a fantastic way to unwind, challenge myself in a different way, and enjoy some friendly competition.

These activities are more than just hobbies; they're my go-to for managing stress. The quiet focus of gardening or the strategic thinking required in billiards helps clear my mind and provides a much-needed balance to the intensity of my work. It's all about finding those pockets of calm and engagement outside of the digital realm.


## My Journey So Far 🚀


And now, I'm on an exciting new path! I'm currently channeling my energy and expertise into freelancing on **Upwork**. It's a fantastic platform that allows me to connect with diverse projects and clients, and I'm genuinely enjoying the flexibility and focus it brings. This shift has given me more time to dedicate to the work I love, and I'm excited about the opportunities it presents.
